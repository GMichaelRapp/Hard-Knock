### Welcome to Simulacrum {#welcome-id}

**The war began over two decades ago . . .**

No one really knows how the war began—to be honest. That’d make some things easier to process. What we know is that at the beginning, there were clearer sides, clearer objectives, rules were followed, and things were more respectable, but things soon devolved after the two opposing governments collapsed. Thousands of factions sprouted up everywhere, and with plenty of weapons, material, and personnel to fight a prolonged and bloody conflict. 

The remaining Feds, those who held out for the Old Republic, tried to keep the war respectable by putting pressure on the different factions to stop fighting, to unite and form a new government, a new republic. They warned of foreign influences, but no one cared, not anymore. Some say the Russians were first to intervene, but this is purely speculation. The Russians began their intervention in the continent’s conflict in Alaska, only to be absorbed by a protracted conflict with Americans and Canadians. The Chinese sought to take Hawaii, and other American islands, but the Feds and their navy stopped them. The Chinese later began showing up along the Pacific Coast, only to be bogged down in the bipolar and violent conflicts there. 

About ten years into the conflict, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico made a concerted effort to bring unity and peace to the former United States. Canada and Mexico later withdrew from the peace efforts when the fighting began spilling across their own borders. The E.U. kept their peacekeepers on the East Coast, in what used to be New England, until the war ended about a year ago. When the war ended, the E.U. peacekeepers became U.N peacekeepers, who were supplemented by soldiers from nations across the globe. 

When the Second American Civil War turned twenty-five, it was like everyone was exhausted from the fighting. It wasn’t the civil war we’d been sold in popular media. There were no two sides, gallantly fighting for supposedly worthy causes. Instead, it was more like Yugoslavia, a total and utter breakdown of civilization and human decency. Entire cities were wiped off the map. Millions died. Millions were displaced. Still yet, millions more were left with the scars of a protracted and bloody war. 

The Provisional Government, a coalition of over a hundred factions, declared the war over a year after the twenty-fifth anniversary of conflict’s start. Under the Provisional Government, peace was to be had. Those who helped create and maintain the peace were to be given a second chance, no matter what they did during the conflict. Peace and reconciliation for all who wanted it. Those who defied it were to be dealt with swiftly. 

But when you’ve fought a war to end all wars, how can you give up your guns? How can you allow peace to begin? How can you allow your enemies to remake tomorrow alongside you when nothing was ever fully resolved? 

**You survived the war, but now you must find a way to survive the peace.**
